Notes for blog post:

Many data classes had Context, due to Database or SharedPreferences access
I refactored some of them to have static initialize methods, then passed the context in then
Then I extracted the Class out to an Interface, and passed the Context to the interface
I setup a series of initialize calls in Application onCreate, instead of in Activity.onCreate
Android documentation seems to prefer Activity of using Application, but when porting code to IOS, Application comesin handy.

General workflow:

	Run j2obc
	Look at class of first error
	Remove all android classes (esp. Context)
	Repeat

Commonly used generic android classes:
	JsonReader
	JsonWriter
	SharedPreferences
	Color
	Paint
